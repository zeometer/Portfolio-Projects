# Portfolio-Projects

These are a series of projects I've completed as I gain skills and experience in SQL for data analysis. 

For all projects, unless otherwise stated, I am using MS SQL Server 2019 to build and perform these queries. 

Each specific project will have a top-level comment describing:
- where and how the data was sourced
- the date in which the data was obtained and/or the dates in which the data is relevant 
- specific skills utilized within the query

Many of these queries, in particular the views, are created to generate visualizations and/or dashboards.
Those can be found on my Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zeometer).

Version numbers (v01, v02, etc.) exist whenever changes are made to the queries. Changes are denoted within the files themselves.

If you have any questions, comments or insights, please reach out! :-)
